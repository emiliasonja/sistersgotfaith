    <p>I am retrieving publicly available data from Pinterest and uploading new content programmatically via the Pinterest API, ensuring full compliance with Pinterest's data usage policies. I do not modify or obscure content, avoiding using filters or edits on Pins. I do not create new content by altering Pins to be shared through my app.
I do not store any data obtained through the API and make a fresh API request whenever data is needed. This ensures that all data, such as pins and boards, is retrieved in real-time for content analysis and sharing new content with Pinterest, without retaining any previously fetched information. No personal data is accessed, and all actions are performed in careful accordance with Pinterest's guidelines.</p>
