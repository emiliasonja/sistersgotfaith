    <p>My app uses the Pinterest API to retrieve publicly available data such as pins and boards, specifically focusing on engagement metrics like comments and saves, to analyze real-time trends that can inform my brand's content strategy. I do not modify, obscure, or add filters to any pins obtained through the API. I will only share original, brand-specific content on Pinterest, adhering to Pinterestâ€™s content guidelines to ensure the posts are relevant, high-quality, and not misleading.

I do not store any data obtained from the API. Every time data is needed, my app makes a fresh request to Pinterest, ensuring all data used is retrieved in real-time. The app does not interact with or store personal data, and all actions are performed with full compliance with Pinterest's data usage policies. The app will solely be used for my personal brand to analyze trends and upload relevant content to Pinterest.</p>
